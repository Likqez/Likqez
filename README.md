# Lukas Lanzner - Likqez

Hello everyone, I'm Lukas, an 18 years old student from Stuttgart.
At the moment I am working on my "Abitur" with a special focus on the subject information technology.
I am always trying to expand my knowledge and perfect my skills.
Working on diverse projects is fun for me. Except it's only frontend 🤡  
    
I’m looking forward to collaborating on more OSS projects. Maybe something using Java 🍵 or Docker🐳?

Suggestions or improvements for OSS Projects are very welcome! Please feel free to contact 💬 me.
